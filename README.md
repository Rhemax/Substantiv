This is an Android app, to help people memorizing the gender of nouns in German and it also includes rules that are helpful to recognize the gender. 
The strong point of this application, as well as what differentiates it from the multitude of applications on "Google Play", is that together with learning the noun gender, the learner will discover certain rules and helpful hints that will help him/her to recognize German noun gender.


Features:

  -	1000 most popular German nouns
  - majority of the nouns are accompanied by the rules and clues that help to recognize their gender.
  -  The game has 2 play modes: 
    * learning the type of the nouns ("Learning - mode")
    * learning random nouns ("Random/Random - mode")

The most difficult nouns can be learned using "The heavy" mode.


> Memorizing the rules and clues that are helpful in determining the gender of nouns, 
> will help the user create the ability to recognize the genders of nouns intuitively,
> the same way native speakers do.

I want to mention that not all German nouns have rules that help the learner understand the gender, or there are no tips to help the learner understand them, thatâ€™s, why they should be memorized by the learner, together with the article "der", "die", "das".
